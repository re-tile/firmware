	 * Data flows between the host and tile, and vice versa, as
	 * sequences of packets.  A packet comprises a 2-byte header,
	 * followed by data.  Right now the header is just a little-endian
	 * count of the number of data bytes following it, which must be at
	 * least 1.  If we start supporting multiple channel numbers, the
	 * header will probably also contain those, and might grow.  The
	 * packetization is done only to allow us to send data blocks which
	 * are not a multiple of 8 bytes long, since the hardware only
	 * supports that alignment; it is not done to provide message
	 * boundaries.  Thus, a driver write request may be contained in
	 * multiple packets, and a packet may contain data from multiple
	 * requests.
